AI is not permitted in any form on my repos. Anyone caught using AI to generate code will be banned permanently. Any PRs including AI related content will be denied.

AI is likely the furture of programming, but it is not the present. AI is unpredictable and exploitable. To prevent all AI related exploits, it has been banned for the time being. On top of that AI is unreliable in its output, sometimes giving code that is too verbose, code that is poorly understood by the prompter or code that is just wrong. AI generated code is harder to debug as the prompter likely doesn't know how the code works.

AI will always be banned for images, this includes but is not limited to logos, icons and backgrounds.
