# What is a testing project?

Testing projects are projects that will be eventually discontinued. The goal is for me to learn about a small system in a larger project I work on. Once the testing is complete the repo will be archived.

# How do I know what is a testing project?

All testing projects have 2 distinct characteristics:

1. It has a very liberal license, either [BSD 2 clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-2-clause) or [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

2. It will have a link to this info page, something along the lines of:

```
Warning: This project is not meant for daily use. This is a small part of [project code name]

```

# What will become of the testing projects?

As mentioned above, the repo will be marked as "archived". Anyone is free to clone the repo at any time. The "full" project will also be open souce but likley with a different, more restrictive license, like[ GPLv2 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

All testing project will link back to any full project, and the full project's code will be available on this same github page as well.

# How can I give feedback?

You can go to a testing project's github issues page and submit a new issue with the tag `Feedback`. The page will describe what about the testing project I am looking for.

# Can I use the app anyways?

Of course, but as the description on the testing project page will tell you, it may be discontinued at any time, and settings/data saved may not nessecarily be supported in the full project. It is for this reason that relying on the testing project is not reccommended, instead keep your eyes peeled for the full project when it releases.
